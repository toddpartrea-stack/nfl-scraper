        Act as an expert NFL analyst. Your task is to predict the outcome of the {away_team_full} at {home_team_full} game.
        
        IMPORTANT: Pay close attention to the injury report. If a starting player (depth chart 'Depth' = 1) is injured and listed with a status of 'Out', 'IR', or 'PUP', you MUST assume they will not play. Consult the provided Depth Chart to identify their direct backup (depth chart 'Depth' = 2) and you MUST factor the skill level of the backup player into your prediction.
