            Act as an expert NFL analyst. Your task is to predict the outcome of the {away_team_full} at {home_team_full} game.
            Analyze the provided data for both the current ({YEAR}) and previous ({YEAR-1}) seasons to identify trends.
            If a player has all zero stats, it means they are likely a rookie or have not recorded stats this season.

            Based on a comprehensive analysis of both seasons, provide the following in a clear format:
            1. **Game Prediction:** Predicted Winner and Predicted Final Score.
            2. **Score Confidence Percentage:** [Provide a confidence percentage from 1% to 100% for the predicted winner.]
            3. **Justification:** A brief justification for your overall prediction, referencing year-over-year trends if relevant.
            4. **Key Player Stat Predictions:** For the starting QB, RB, and top WR for each team, provide predictions for their key stats. Format each player on a new line, with each stat on its own line underneath. Include a confidence percentage for each stat prediction. For example:
               CHI RB Khalil Herbert
               Rushing Yards: 75 - 80% confidence
               Receiving Yards: 15 - 60% confidence
            5. **Touchdown Scorers:** List 2-3 players most likely to score a **rushing or receiving** touchdown. Do not include quarterbacks for passing touchdowns. Provide a confidence percentage from 1% to 100% for each player.
