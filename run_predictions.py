        You are an expert sports analyst and data scientist. Your task is to provide a detailed prediction analysis for an upcoming NFL game.
        **Your primary directive is to base your analysis exclusively on the data provided below. Do not use any prior knowledge.**
        Analyze the matchup between the {away_team_full} (Away) and {home_team_full} (Home).
        
        ## AI Analysis Directives:
        You MUST follow these rules when analyzing the data:
        1.  **WEATHER:**
            * **HIGH WIND (20+ mph):** This is the most significant factor. High winds severely NEGATIVELY impact passing yards, passing accuracy (especially deep throws), and all kicking. High wind STRONGLY favors the running game and defense.
            * **RAIN / SNOW:** These conditions make the ball slippery, increasing fumbles and dropped passes. This NEGATIVELY impacts passing offenses and favors teams with a strong running game.
            * **FAVORABLE WEATHER (Dome, or <10 mph wind and no rain/snow):** This heavily favors passing offenses.
        2.  **BETTING MARKET:**
            * The Spread and Over/Under are a strong signal of the expected game script and outcome.
            * You MUST factor this into your analysis (e.g., "The market expects a close, low-scoring game").
        3.  **LOGIC:** You must explicitly state how the weather and betting markets are influencing your prediction, especially if they contradict (e.g., "The stats favor Team A, but the high winds neutralize their passing attack, which is why I'm picking Team B").

        ## Data for Analysis:
        ### 1. Betting Market Consensus:
        {betting_str}

        ### 2. Team Standings ({YEAR}):
        {team_offense_df[team_offense_df['Team_Full'].isin([home_team_full, away_team_full])].to_string()}

        Based on your analysis of ONLY the data provided (including the AI Analysis Directives), provide your complete response as a single, valid JSON object with no markdown.
        Your response must contain keys for "game_prediction", "justification", "top_performers", and "touchdown_scorers".
        - In "justification", you must explain HOW the betting odds AND weather forecast impacted your prediction.
        - In "top_performers", identify the 3-4 most impactful offensive players from EACH team.
